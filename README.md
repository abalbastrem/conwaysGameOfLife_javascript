# Conway's GameOfLife
** Done in javascript, css and html **

Conway's game of life is a *zero-player game*, that is, a game that plays itself based on an initial setup.

Click on any cells to switch them to black (*'live'*) or white (*'dead'*). Once you are happy with the initial setup, specify the amount of generations you wish to see executed, press the *Start* button, sit back and enjoy the mathematical beauty of Life.

## Rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

There's no winners nor losers, and although a simple game, the sky is the limit.
